In December of 1953, a lone well sat atop the geological sandwich of shale, dolomite, and shale layers known as the Bakken Formation. Beneath the surface, an estimated 18 to 24 billion barrels of oil lay largely untapped until the last twenty years, when drilling technologies made possible oil and natural gas extraction from dense, impermeable rock. 

As of Feb. 2016, more than 10,000 active wells populate the Bakken region over western North Dakota and eastern Montana.The sudden rise--and rapid fall--of oil production in the Bakkens has had profound effects on the number of oilfield spills that take place during the exploration and production phases of drilling. 

These spills, which range from oil to wastewater laden with heavy metals to mysterious contaminants like "20# Gelled Fluid," are reported by oil and gas companies to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources  which shares the information with the Department of Health.

This chart shows the number of oilfield spills on a month by month basis.
