Hi Chris,

I am trying to move the y-axis to the right side of the chart. I know I need to mess with the svg.append("g")
        .attr("class", "y axis")

before I call the y-axis, but I'm confused about the syntax for transform, translate to move the axis from its default. So far, I have managed to make the y-axis disappear and reappear in the same place (by breaking the code.)

I've just managed to scrape my website and will update the temporary data with up-to-date data that goes through April 2016, and want to draw an arrow highlighting the end of 2014, when oil prices started to fall. This is something I want to tackle over the weeknend.

I also need to add more info the the graph and make it prettier. 

Please let me know if you have any other suggestions. I can't do a lot, but I can tackle tasks one at a time.
