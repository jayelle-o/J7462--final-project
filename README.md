Hi Chris,

Here is my final project. I had one formatting issue with the month format in the tool tips. I'm reading and not understanding the d3 documentation that would let me change yyyy-mm into month name(%b)-yyyy. 

Also, I added a deck and tested it out on the left and right side of the graphic. It looks weird on either side, but less weird as a column on the right.

As usual, feedback is very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Jen
